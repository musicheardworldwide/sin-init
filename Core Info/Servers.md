## Domains and Their Purpose

### 1. [https://lastwinnersllc.com](https://lastwinnersllc.com) - WordPress
- **Purpose**: This is the business website that will display services and portfolios for everything we do in totality.

### 2. [https://hub.lastwinnersllc.com](https://hub.lastwinnersllc.com) - Nextcloud
- **Purpose**: This is intended to be the central hub for everything. It will house all files, photos, music, and backend data, serving as the origin point for all resources.

### 3. [https://musicheardworldwide.com](https://musicheardworldwide.com) - WordPress
- **Purpose**: This website will explain in depth what we’re aiming to do with music. It will include all specifics on what we do and how we do it.

### 4. [https://heargoodmusic.com](https://heargoodmusic.com) - Ampache Music Server
- **Purpose**: This is where our music will be stored and available for streaming.  
- **Integration Goal**: I want this Ampache server to be integrated via API into all aspects of music and our artists.

### 5. [https://chat.musicheardworldwide.com](https://chat.musicheardworldwide.com) - Open Web-UI
- **Purpose**: This will eventually serve as a user interface where users can:
    - Speak to their personal agent about all aspects of their account.
    - Ask questions or make edits.
    - Feel comforted and supported within this large system.
