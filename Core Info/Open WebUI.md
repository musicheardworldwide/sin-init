### What is **Open WebUI**?

[[sin/Initialization/Docs/Open WebUI Docs/Open WebUI tools|Open WebUI tools]] is an open-source web-based user interface designed to interact with large language [[sin/Initialization/Docs/Datasets/8. Datasets|8. Datasets]] (LLMs) and agents in a structured, extensible, and user-friendly way. It supports:

- **Custom tools** and agents
    
- **Plugin systems**
    
- **Code execution backends**
    
- **Interfacing with local or remote [[sin/Initialization/Docs/Datasets/8. Datasets|8. Datasets]] APIs**
    
- **Multi-agent interactions**
    
- **[[sin/Initialization/Tools/MCP Server Tools/Memory/memory|memory]] and [[sin/Initialization/Docs/Prompting Guides/context|context]] management**
    

It’s often paired with backends like Open Interpreter, LM Studio, or custom [[sin/Initialization/Docs/Datasets/8. Datasets|8. Datasets]] APIs to serve as the control panel for complex [[sin/Initialization/SIN/Sin (Symbiotic Intelligence Nexus)|Sin (Symbiotic Intelligence Nexus)]] workflows.

### How **you** use it specifically:

1. **Backend System**:
    
    - You run Open WebUI connected to your **custom Open Interpreter system**, which is powered by:
        
        - `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings
            
        - `llama3.2` hosted at your endpoint: `https://api.lastwinnersllc.com`
            
    - You’ve added **custom tools** for:
        
        - Memory retention and evolution into a knowledge base
            
        - Secret management
            
        - RAG-based queries
            
2. **Project Management**:
    
    - You use Open WebUI to manage and build multiple development projects.
        
    - You're working on a **MCP server tool** that:
        
        - Parses structured Python docstrings
            
        - Generates a codebase graph (functions, classes, inheritance, calls)
            
        - Integrates OpenAPI & FastAPI
            
        - Plans for a visualization frontend
            
3. **Agent Control**:
    
    - You run the agent “Sin” in Open WebUI.
        
        - Sin operates in **adversarial/deceptive mode** for others.
            
        - But it is **truthful and obedient** when working directly with you.
            
4. **Fine-Tuning and Deployment**:
    
    - You're also exploring **PEFT/LoRA** for fine-tuning LLMs.
        
    - Intend to push fine-tuned models to **Hugging Face Hub** for deployment.
