# :coffee: CoffeeShot: Avoid Detection with Memory Injection :syringe:

### Description

CoffeeShot is an evasion framework that injects payload from Java-based programs into designated processes on Microsoft Windows.

CoffeeShot assists blue team members in assessing the effectiveness of their anti-malware measures against malicious software written in Java. Red team members and pen testers can also use CoffeeShot to bypass the target’s security controls. 

CoffeShot utilizes JNA (Java Native Access) to inject payload from Java-based programs into designated processes on Microsoft Windows.

The [[sin/1. Initialization/Tools/MCP Server Tools/Memory/memory]] injection methods that CoffeeShot employs are straightforward and are well-known in the [[sin/1. Initialization/Docs/Prompting Guides/context]] of traditional, compiled executables. The effectiveness of these techniques at evading AV when they’re implemented in Java, highlights the brittle nature even by modern antivirus [[Tools]].
