# MailSniper

### Description
MailSniper is a PowerShell-based penetration testing tool whose primary purpose is to search through [[sin/Initialization/Tools/Open WebUI Tools/Email/Email]] in a Microsoft Exchange environment for specific terms (i.e. passwords, insider intel, network architecture [[sin/Initialization/Docs/Open WebUI Docs/Information/Information]], etc.). It can be used as a non-administrative user to search their own [[sin/Initialization/Tools/Open WebUI Tools/Email/Email]], or by an Exchange administrator to search the mailboxes of every user in a domain.

MailSniper includes additional modules for attacking externally-facing Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange Web Services (EWS) portals. With MailSniper, it is also possible to: perform password spraying attacks, enumerate internal domain names and usernames, locate inboxes with too broad permissions, and gather the Global Address List containing all [[sin/Initialization/Tools/Open WebUI Tools/Email/Email]] addresses of users at an organization from OWA and EWS.
